# anime-recommendation-software
This is a very simple anime recommendation software.

The goal was not to develop a full-fledged prouduct but rather a rough sketch of how the program would work. 
There are several things that could be added to make the product, such as: 
- Age Based Recommendation
- Location Based Recommendation
- Sub/Dub Recommendation
- Use of database with more anime.

Developers Note:
I have been learning Python for 2 weeks in my freetime outside of school and decided to test my current capabilties by writing a program that utilizies what I know.
